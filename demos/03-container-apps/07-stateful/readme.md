# Stateful Apps using Volume Mounts & Persistent Storage

In this demo we will attach a share created in Azure Storage Account to a container app. This will allow us to store data in a persistent manner.

## Demo

- Take detailed instructions from `deploy-stateful-app.azcli`.

- To attach Azure Files as storage download the `yaml` for the container app to modify it and to mount a volume to the container app. Upload it after you have modified it.

    ```bash
    az containerapp show -n $imgUploader -g $grp -o yaml > uploader.yaml
    ```

    ```yaml
    volumeMounts:
    - volumeName: azure-files-volume
        mountPath: /app/images
    ```

    ```yaml
    - name: azure-file-volume
        storageType: AzureFile
        storageName: mtn-azfiles
    ```
